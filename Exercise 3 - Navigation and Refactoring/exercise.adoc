=== Extracting Methods

The "extract method" refactor is used a lot. It's helpful for when you have a block of code you want to extract into it's own method.

    pastColor.addEventListener("click", () => {
      this.setColor(color);
    });

3. Delete the `"` at the start of each line
4. Move all the cursors the end of their relative lines with kbd:[Ctrl] / kbd:[Cmd] + kbd:[→]
5. Use kbd:[Alt] / kbd:[Option] + kbd:[Shift] + kbd:[←] to select text on all lines back to the last `"` and delete the `"`
6. Use kbd:[Ctrl] / kbd:[Cmd] + kbd:[←] to move the cursor to the front of the line and add a space
