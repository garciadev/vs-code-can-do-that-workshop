= Exercise 4: Debugging

== Debug a JavaScript file

Node debugging is built-in to VS Code. You can run any code in the debugger just by pressing kbd:[F5] on a JavaScript file.

Open the `index.js` file in the `1-simple-node` folder. Run it with the Node Debugger.

* Press kbd:[F5]

== Auto-Attach

Run the `index.js` file in the `2-launch-configs` folder. Auto-attach to it with VS Code.

.Solution

====
* kbd:[Ctrl] / kbd:[Cmd] + kbd:[Shift] + kbd:[P] 
* Select "Toggle Auto Attach"
* Set a breakpoint in the `index.js` file
* Open the integrated terminal
* Execute the `index.js` file in inspect mode
    ----
    node --inspect-brk index.js
    ----
====

== Launch Config

Create a launch config that attaches to a running debug process in the `2-launch-configs` folder.

.Solution
[%collapsible]
====
* Make sure "Auto Attach" is toggled off in VS Code
* Run the `index.js` file from the integrated terminal in inspect mode
----
  node --inspect-brk index.js
----
* Open the Debug panel in VS Code
* Open the drop-down list at the top and select "Add Config (2-launch-configs)"
* Select "Node" from the prompt
* Change the name to "Attach To Node"
* Change the "request" type to "attach"
* Select "Attach To Node" from the drop down list at the top and press the green button
====

Change the launch config to both launch and attach to the process.

.Solution
[%collapsible]
====
* Open the `launch.config` file in the `2-launch-configs` folder
* Change the name to "Launch Node"
* Change the "request" type to "launch"
* Select "Launch Node" from the drop down list at the top and press the green button
====

== Debugging Browser Apps

The application in `3-debug-browser-apps` is broken. Create a launch configuration to launch it in Chrome and debug.

.Solution

====
* Switch to the Debug panel in VS Code
* Select "Add config (3-debug-browser-apps)"
* Change the "name" to "Debug Browser App"
* Select "Debug Browser App" in the drop down list at the top and click the green button
* Good luck

== Compound Launch Configurations

VS Code can launch multiple debuggers at the same time. This is useful for when you want to debug an app that has both a client and a server component and both need to be running for the app to work.

Open the project in `4-compound-launch-config` and add two launch configurations:

1. Launch the `server/server.js` file with the Node debugger
2. Launch `npm start` and attach the Chrome Debugger 

Create a compound launch configuration to launch both debuggers at the same time.

.Solution
[%collapsible]
====
* Open the Debug panel in VS Code
* Select "Add launch config (4-compound-launch-config)"
*  Select "Node.js" from the list
*  Change the "program" setting to...
----
"program": "${workspaceFolder}/server/server.js"
----
*  Add a `console` setting and set it to `integratedTerminal`
----
"console" "integratedTerminal"
----

*  Click the "Add Configuration" button at the bottom right corner of the `launch.config` file screen
*  Select "Chrome: Launch" from the list
*  Change the "url" to `http://localhost:3000`
----
"url": "http://localhost:3000"
----
* Add a setting to launch the React App with npm
----
"preLaunchTask": "npm: start"
----
* Set the `webRoot` setting to `${workspaceFolder}/src`
----
"webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}/src"
----

* Add a new setting above the main "configurations" node called "compound"
----
"compounds": [
  {
    "name": "Launch Program/Chrome",
    "configurations": ["Launch Program", "Launch Chrome"]
  }
],
----

* Select "Launch Program/Chrome" from the drop down list and press the green button
